# Azure Sphere H-Bridge
This implements an H-Bridge motor interafce for the Azure Sphere using GPIO and a L293D Push Pull 4 Channel Driver. It is a port of a previous Azure IoT SDK Quickstart Telemetry project available that is part of the [az-iothub-ps](https://github.com/djaus2/az-iothub-ps) repository. This port cuurrently doesn't include the IOT Hub Telemetry (later) aspect but does continuously control the motor from a loop in the app's main function.
